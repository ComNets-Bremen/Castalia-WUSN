# Castalia-WUSN

This is an extension of the Castalia framework for OMNeT++. The main difference to the original Castalia is that it is ported to OMNeT++ v5 and that it enables simulations of volumetric water content (VWC) and its correspoding undeground path loss model. Thus, complex simulations can be deisgned with changing VWC, which if taken into account in the underground path loss model and changes the transmission quality.
